function plot_freq_response(Fd, HF, fsample, figure_num)
%plot_freq_response Plots the frequency response of H(F)
%   Fd = an array of digital frequency values (in units of 
%        cycles/sample) that correspond to the H(F) frequency 
%        response data values 
%   HF = an array of complex H(F) DTFT frequency response values to 
%        plot 
%   fsample = sampling frequency (in units of samples / second) 
%   figure_num = number of the 1st figure to use for the two plots
